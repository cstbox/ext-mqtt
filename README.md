# CSTBox MQTT gateway extension

This repository contains the code for the extension adding a gateway
between the [CSTBox framework](http://cstbox.cstb.fr) internal message bus 
and [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/).

It embeds a stripped down version of [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt) 
Python client library.

## WARNING

This is work in progress and not certified as fully working for the moment.
