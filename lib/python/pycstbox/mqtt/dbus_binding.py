""" D-Bus binding layer of the MQTT gateway.

This module implements the building blocks for interfacing the :py:class:`MQTTConnector` class
with the CSTBox D-Bus layer.

The feature is provided by the :py:class:`MQTTGatewayServiceObject` which is the worker instance
of the service.

The gateway service object works in association with the filters provided by the
application. The role of these filters is to filter messages allowing to cross the CSTBox/MQTT
boundary, and to translate accepted ones. Their prototypes is specified by classes :py:class:`InboundFilter`
and :py:class:`OutboundFilter` provided by the package module :py:mod:`pycstbox.mqtt.core`.

        - listens to both sensor and control CSTBox buses for processing circulating messages for

        - creates a MQTT client for the broker, and listens to the relevant MQTT top√Æcs,

    which ones are allowed to cross the boundaries. This layer takes also care of converting the messages
    in the proper form before publishing.

    It is the responsibility of the application to provide these filters when creating an instance of this
    service object (refer to the `__init__` method signature). It is valid to omit one of them, the absence of
    filter meaning that nothing will go through in the corresponding direction.
